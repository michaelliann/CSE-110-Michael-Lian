## Programming Experience

Throughout my three years here at UCSD, I have learned a lot and gained plenty of programming experience. At first, I was intimidated by programming since CSE 8A was my first time learning how to write code. However, I am now much more confident in my programming skills after taking the following programming classes:

- CSE 8A
- CSE 8B
- CSE 12
- CSE 30
- CSE 100

Through these classes, I have learned languages such as:

- [x] Python
- [x] Java
- [x] C
- [x] C++

Through the skills that I have learned in class, I was able to do my own side projects ([such as this](https://github.com/michaelliann/LitFit)) and work as a Software Developer Intern at General Atomics during the summer of 2022. Through this experience, I gained experience in C# and real world software development. From going from writing ```print("Hello, World")``` in Python as my first line of code to learning all these different languages and gaining real world experience is something that I am proud of. I am always yearning to learn more to improve my skills. As Vince Lombardi once said:
